# Project Title

The goal of this project is to convert variants in a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into a FASTA file. 

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
python script.py input_fasta_file output_fasta_file name variants_str
```
where input_fasta is the NC_012920.1.fasta file with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) of the Human Mitochondrial DNA,
the output file is the desired name of the output file,
the name is the name included in the first line of the outpu FASTA file
variants_str is a string of variants that conform to forensic nomenclature (ref): e.g. "A73G A523- -315.1C" indicating a subsitution, a deletion, and an insertion.
